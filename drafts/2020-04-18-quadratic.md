### Abstract

Hospital facilities are known as functionally complex buildings. There are usually configurational problems that lead to inefficient transportation processes for patients, medical staff, and/or logistics of materials. The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a well-known problem in the field of Operations Research from the category of the facility's location/allocation problems. This paper presents a formulation of such logistics issues as a QAP for space planning processes aimed at renovation of existing hospitals, a heuristic QAP solver, and its implementation as a computational design tool designed to be used by architects. This tool minimizes the internal transportation processes between interrelated facilities where each facility is assigned to a location in an existing building. The QAP formulation takes into account both the flows between facilities and distances between locations. The distance matrix is obtained from the spatial network of the building by using graph traversal techniques. Using one exemplary test-case, we demonstrate the potential of this method in the context of hospital layout design/re-design tasks. Finally, we discuss the results and possible further developments with respect to a generic computational space planning framework.
