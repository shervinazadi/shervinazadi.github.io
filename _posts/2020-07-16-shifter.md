In The Shifter, we explore new typologies of space arising from dynamic architectural elements embedded in a syntactical structure. We extract a basic grammar for the dynamic interactions of spaces and formalize this grammar into a computational embodied entity, The Shifter. Later on, this dynamic embodiment is exposed to different contexts and human behaviours in order to generate a basis for human-space interaction studies. Ultimately, permutations of these interactions will be represented in a set of motion graphics to layout an expedition pathway in this obscure realm.
