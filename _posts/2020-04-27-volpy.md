[VolPy](https://github.com/shervinazadi/GSS_PyHou_Setup) is an open-source python package for scientific analyses and manipulation of volumetric data.

## Vision

VolPy aims to facilitate the conversion of geometries between surface-based data models and volume-based data models. Therefore, it envisions a set of rasterization and isosurface algorithms. Moreover, VolPy aims to include a variety of volume-based and surface-based data models as the input and output formats of its processes to make it more accessible.

## Credits

VolPy is currently being developed in GSS-Lab by Shervin Azadi and Pirouz Nourian.
