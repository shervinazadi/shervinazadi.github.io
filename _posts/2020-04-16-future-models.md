[Future Models](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=47726) is a seminar for Master of Architecture students. It accompanies the [The Why Factory](https://thewhyfactory.com/) MSc Studio, at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I have helped to create and teach this course in collaboration with [Dr. Ir. Pirouz Nourian](https://sites.google.com/site/pirouznourian/about-me?authuser=0), Ir. Hans Hoogenboom and Ir. Karim Daw.

In this seminar, students are introduced to agent-based models as a design tool. They learn that instead of direct implementation of high-level and large scale decisions, they can focus on the formulation of local behavioural logic for agents and the overlaying behaviour of agents in a simulation can give rise to large-scale and high-level organizations and configurations.

- Students learn about the mathematical and computational necessary for basic geometric manipulation
- They learn about the basics of data-analyses in order to create a more realistic environment for agents.
- They are introduced to graph theory in order to model the relations of agents.
