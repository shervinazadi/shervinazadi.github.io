### Work in progress! 

This project is a collaboration with [Dr. Eleonora Brembilla](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/eleonora-brembilla-b5676a76) and [Dr. Pirouz Nourian](https://sites.google.com/site/pirouznourian/about-me) with a focus on translating the EN 17037 standards to simulation workflows. By generalizing the suggested methods in the standard, this project aims to map the possibility space of the spaces that comply with the standards. This mapping can be used to investigate the morphological consequences of the standard in the urban scale and potentials of improving the standards.
