GoDesign is a research project initiated as part of GSS-Lab by [Dr. Ir. Pirouz Nourian](https://sites.google.com/site/pirouznourian/about-me?authuser=0) and Shervin Azadi. GoDesign aims to facilitate the participation of stakeholders in a construction project by gamifying the decision-making process. More specifically, GoDesign attempts to mathematically formulate a spatial decision-making process.

This project is funded by Actieagenda Ruimtelijk Ontwerp 2017 - 2020, Samenwerken aan Ontwerpkracht, Ontwerp en Overheid.
