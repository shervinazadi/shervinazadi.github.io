GoDesign is a research project initiated as part of GSS-Lab by Dr. Pirouz Nourian and Shervin Azadi. GoDesign aims to facilitate the participation of stakeholders in a construction project by gamifying the decision-making process. More specifically, GoDesign attempts to mathematically formulate a spatial decision-making process

This project is funded by Actieagenda Ruimtelijk Ontwerp 2017 - 2020, Samenwerken aan Ontwerpkracht, Ontwerp en Overheid.
