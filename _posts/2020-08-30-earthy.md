The idea of computational architecture more often implies a high-tech construction. However, computational processes can enable the designer to orchestrate the construction phase to decrease its dependency on infrastructures. This approach can have an added-value in the construction of shelters in remote and under-developed areas.

Beyond the social cause, this approach offers immense educational opportunities to student to learn and understand the possibilities of computational design and utilize them to simplify the construction process. Within this approach, the student focuses on the complexities that arise from the discrepancy of the high-tech computational methods and the low-tech construction procedures.

The mathematical and computational foundations of this course are closely tied to [PolyShell](https://shervinazadi.com/p/polyshell) and [GoDesign](https://shervinazadi.com/p/godesign)research projects. Students will utilize [topoGenesis](https://shervinazadi.com/p/topogenesis) python library to plan and design their project computationally.
