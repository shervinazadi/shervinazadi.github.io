Recently, Generative approaches has been increasingly applied in design processes. They offer a computationally robust framework that on one hand is not topologically bounded like parametric framework and on the other hand makes new advances in computational technologies like AI, Agent-Based Model and Spectra Analyses more accessible. They also provide the possibility for gamification of the design process which will ultimately increase the potential for participation.

Here you can find the project that I have used this framework in:
