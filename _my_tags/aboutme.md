Shervin Azadi is a researcher/developer based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He holds a BSc in Architectural Engineering from the University of Tehran, & MSc in Architecture (cum laude) from TU Delft. He is currently a researcher at Design Informatics Chair in TU Delft.

Shervinâ€™s main interest lies in the systematic understanding and utilization of complex inter-relation of spatial qualities and the socio-economic context. He primarily focuses on computational simulations that reveal the intricate details of these complex relations. He has developed algorithms and tool-sets such as [topoGenesis](https://topogenesis.readthedocs.io) and [emergentium.io](https://emergentium.io/) for spatial analysis and simulations. Nevertheless, his current research investigates the potentials of a mathematical/computational formulation of the architectural design process as a series of decision-making processes, leading to a Computational Generative Design process. More specifically, he looks into the possibility of Multi-Agent Systems and Participatory Games as generative interfaces for design.
