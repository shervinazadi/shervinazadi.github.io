Shervin Azadi is a researcher / developer based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He holds a BSc in Architectural Engineering from the University of Tehran, & MSc in Architecture (cumlaude) from TU Delft. He is currently a researcher at Design Informatics Chair in TU Delft.

Shervinâ€™s speciality is Computational Design. He has developed algorithms and created tools for analyses of light, visibility and accessibility in architecture. Nevertheless, his current research investigates the potentials of a mathematical / computational formulation of the architectural design problem, which can ultimately lead to a Computational Generative Design process. More specifically, he looks into the possibility of Graph Grammars and Agent-Based Models as generative interfaces for design.
