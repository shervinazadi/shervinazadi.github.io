GSS-Lab is a new initiative of I and my friend and professor [Dr. Ir. Pirouz Nourian](https://sites.google.com/site/pirouznourian/about-me?authuser=0) and I for framing our research and development agendas around the axis of generative systems and generative sciences. This Lab aims to bring in all the generative methodologies and toolsets that we have created. This is a work in progress. We will have a dedicated website for this lab soon.
