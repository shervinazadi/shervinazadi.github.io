SOSAges [Some Other Solution Ages] is a collaborative art project co-founded by [Ardalan SadeghiKivi](https://architecture.mit.edu/student/ardalan-sadeghikivi), and [Shervin Azadi](https://shervinazadi.com/). SOSAges represents the process of de-constructing and reconstructing the environment that it is surrounded by, as an art-piece.
